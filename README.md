## 🏗️ Architecture

EyeNet follows a three-layer architecture:

### Application Layer
- Decision Support System
- Social Media Integration
- User Interface
- API Endpoints

### Monitoring Plane
- Network Monitoring
- Predictive Analysis
- Alert Generation
- Data Collection

### Data Plane
- Hardware Integration
- Metrics Collection
- Raw Data Processing
- Storage Management

## 📈 Predictive Analysis

EyeNet's predictive analysis system uses advanced algorithms to:
- Forecast resource usage trends
- Detect anomalies in system behavior
- Predict potential system failures
- Optimize resource allocation
- Generate proactive alerts

### Monitored Metrics
- CPU Usage
- Memory Utilization
- Disk Space
- Network Traffic
- Application Performance
- System Load
- Service Status

## 🔌 API Integration

EyeNet provides both Northbound and Southbound APIs:

### Northbound API
```php
// Example API call
$client = new EyeNetClient($config);
$metrics = $client->getServerMetrics('server1.example.com');
```

### Southbound API
```php
// Example hardware integration
$monitor = new NetworkMonitor();
$status = $monitor->checkDeviceStatus('switch1');
```
